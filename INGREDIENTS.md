INGREDIENTS

Pizza Dough:

2. 1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) of active dry yeast
3. 3 3/4 cups (490 g) bread flour

5. 2 teaspoons salt
6. 1 teaspoon sugar

Pizza Ingredients:

4. Firm mozzarella cheese, grated
5. Fresh soft mozzarella cheese, separated into small clumps
6. Fontina cheese, grated
7. Parmesan cheese, grated
8. Feta cheese, crumbled
9. Mushrooms, very thinly sliced if raw, otherwise first sautéed
10. Bell peppers, stems and seeds removed, very thinly sliced
11. Italian pepperoncini, thinly sliced
12. Italian sausage, cooked ahead and crumbled
13. Chopped fresh basil
14. Baby arugula, tossed in a little olive oil, added as pizza comes out of the oven

Special equipment:

2. A pizza peel or an edge-less cookie or baking sheet
3. A pizza wheel for cutting the pizza, not required, but easier to deal with than a knife
